Simple program generating a repetitive song based on the user input.

The input should be inserted through terminal and it should have
a from of "{quantity} {container} of {item}". 
E.g. - "99 bottles of beer" or "35 cans of tuna".

It is a simple program with one significant bug -> if you add a container whose plural form
is distinguished from its singular form by something else than just extra "s" at the end,
then the last verse of the song will be incorrect. The purpose of this exercise was to work
with a for loop, so this bug is not very relevant and thus I will not try to correct it in the near future.
